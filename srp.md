# SRP

SRP denotes class has single reason for change.
Classes should be defined clearly with the role and single resposiblity.
Adding many responsiblities will make each responsiblities dependent on one another 
and hamper the maintainability.
Have seen many classes have additional helper methods like Loading configuration , Parsing XML
which will violate SRP
