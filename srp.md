# SRP

SRP makes sure class has single reason for change.
Classes should be defined clearly with the role and single resposiblity.
Adding many resposniblities will make each resposniblities dependent on one another 
and hamper the maintainability.
Have seen many classes have additional helper methods like Loading configuration , Parsing XML
which could have been avoided
