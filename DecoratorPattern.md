# Decorator Pattern

The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Example :
In UI window , out of 3 text boxes (similar object) , one text  box can have scroll bar (dynamic behaviour)
